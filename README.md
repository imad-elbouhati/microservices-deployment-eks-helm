# DevOps with Kubernetes, AWS, Helm, Terraform, and CI/CD

This project showcases my expertise in various DevOps practices and tools. It focuses on deploying Kubernetes on AWS, utilizing Helm for Kubernetes application provisioning, setting up CI/CD pipelines using Gitlab, and establishing disaster recovery and data protection strategies.

## Project Overview

<img width="5910" alt="Untitled" src="https://github.com/imad-elbouhati/microservices-deployment-eks-helm/assets/57508129/581770f8-fc70-49e7-9e46-25bdb0a6c69d">

In this project, I delve into various aspects of DevOps and demonstrate my expertise in utilizing the following key technologies:

- **Kubernetes**: I deployed Kubernetes on AWS. While Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a popular choice.

- **Helm**: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications.

- **CI/CD with Gitlab**: I demonstrate how to build robust CI/CD pipelines using Gitlab, a prominent DevOps tool. I start with a simple CI pipeline and progressively enhance it by introducing continuous delivery and deployment practices. 

- **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**: I define the infrastructure in AWS using Terraform. Terraform enables the codification of infrastructure provisioning, making it easier to manage and scale AWS resources.

- **Disaster Recovery and Data Protection**: I focus on establishing disaster recovery and data protection strategies. I explore techniques such as creating EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume snapshots in AWS and utilizing a third-party tool called Velero. This project underscores the importance of safeguarding data and ensuring business continuity.
